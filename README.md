favPoke is a project made with the aim of practicing my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it!

This site was created using the Pok√©API to fetch the data needed to play the game. Remember that, if abused, the API might refuse to accept your request, resulting in the game breaking. 

If that happens, reload the page and try again. All data is cached locally, as per the API's guidelines.
